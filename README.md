## wysiwyg-list-editor

`wysiwyg-list-editor` allows users to encode rich text and preserve its formatting in HTML tags.

It's main goal is to allow creative ~~unconvenstional, inconsistent~~ ways of writing bullet lists and preseve their formatting as HTML list `<ul>` and `<li>` tags, which can serve as ***CLEAN*** input to other services.

This app is inspired to solve the inconsistencies mentioned in dealing with bullet list text on excel files in the [excel-parser-uploader](https://github.com/ciatph/excel-parser-uploader) mini project.
